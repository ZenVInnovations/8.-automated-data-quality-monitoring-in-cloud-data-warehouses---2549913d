**Automated Data Quality Monitoring in Cloud Data Warehouses**

📌 Introduction
In modern data-driven enterprises, cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift are essential for storing and managing vast amounts of business-critical data. However, ensuring data quality at scale is a significant challenge. This project addresses that challenge by automating data quality checks using AI-based techniques.

🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:

Continuously assess key data quality metrics like completeness, consistency, and accuracy

Automatically detect anomalies indicating potential data issues

Send real-time alerts via email when data integrity problems are found

Promote data governance by ensuring clean, trustworthy data

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Jupyter Notebook – for developing and presenting the solution

pandas – for data ingestion and processing

scikit-learn – for anomaly detection using Isolation Forest

smtplib – to send automated email alerts

⚙️ Workflow Overview
Data Ingestion
Load data from cloud exports (CSV or via DB connector) using pandas.read_csv().

Data Quality Checks

Completeness: Identify null or missing values.

Uniqueness: Detect duplicate records.

Data Type Consistency: Validate data types (e.g., integers, dates).

AI-Based Anomaly Detection
Use Isolation Forest to detect statistical anomalies in numeric features.

Generate Data Quality Report
Summarize issues including nulls, duplicates, and outliers.

Email Alerts
Automatically notify stakeholders via email with the quality report.

🌟 Key Features & Benefits
AI Integration for advanced anomaly detection

Automation of manual data quality checks

Real-Time Alerts for quick resolution

Supports Data Governance and compliance initiatives

📌 Example Use Case
If a company uploads daily sales data to BigQuery, this system can:

Flag missing customer or transaction data

Detect invalid entries (e.g., negative sales)

Alert the data team in real-time to fix upstream issues

📤 Outputs
Data Quality Summary Report (print + email)

Anomaly Detection Scores per row

Automated Email Notification System

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a scalable, AI-driven solution for maintaining high data quality in cloud data warehouses. With open-source tools and automation, it ensures proactive issue detection and resolution, enhancing trust in data and supporting critical decision-making processes.
